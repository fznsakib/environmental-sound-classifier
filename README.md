# deep-learning
Coursework for the Applied Deep Learning unit at the University of Bristol. 

## Labs 

The labsheets involve implementing the fundamentals of deep learning to create fully connected layers and Convolutional Neural Networks which included:

- Stochastic descent
- Pooling
- Batch based training
- Hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc)
- Data augmentation
- Dropout
- Tensorboard monitoring

Code is written in Python 3 with the machine learning framework PyTorch.
