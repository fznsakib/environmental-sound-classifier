# deep-learning
Coursework for the Applied Deep Learning unit at the University of Bristol. Labs include implementing the fundamentals of deep learning such as:

[] - Fully connected layers
[] - Stochastic descent
[] - Convolutional neural networks
[] - Tensorboard monitoring
[] - Hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc)
[] - Data augmentation

Code is written in Python 3 with PyTorch.
